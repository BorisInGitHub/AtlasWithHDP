## Installation

HortonWorks Sandbox from http://hortonworks.com/hdp/downloads/


## Bug

When I create the table in Hive, I don't show them in Atlas UI.



## Steps

1. Download the hortonWorks Sandbox â€‹http://hortonworks.com/hdp/downloads/ and start it.
1. Configure my conf.sh file
1. Launch the 1_LoadToHDFS.sh : it should copy a file to HDFS
1. Launch the 2_CreateTableInHIVE.sh : it should create 2 table in Hive
1. Go to Atlas UI and type the query "Table" ou "DB".


With my server, I show nothing.
